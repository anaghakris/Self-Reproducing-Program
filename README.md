# Self-Reproducing-Program

## Team Members:
- Binal Dhaliwal
- Anagha Krishna
- Bhavneet Bhargava

## Shortcomings
- Our biggest challenge was handling newline characters (/n) properly within the format string. It took    
some experimenting with printf format specifiers to ensure the program would output its own source code.
- To overcome this, during testing, we focused on how newline characters and other special characters were inserted in the format string as a team. Thus, we got our program to self replicate.
